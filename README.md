Dataset Overview
This dataset contains multiple features along with a Matched Score column, which can be used as the target variable for supervised learning models. The dataset is structured in a way that allows us to train machine learning models to predict the matched score based on various independent variables.

Age Requirement – Required age range for the job.
Responsibilities (Job Posting) – Responsibilities associated with the job posting.
Skills Required – Skills required for the job.
Matched Score – Matching score between the candidate and the job position.

Why Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where a model is trained on labeled data. 

In this dataset:
Matched Score is the dependent variable (target) that we want to predict.
Other columns serve as independent variables (features) that influence the target variable.
This dataset is ideal for regression (predicting numerical values) and classification (categorizing scores into groups).

Conclusion:
This dataset is well-suited for supervised learning, particularly for predicting Matched Score using regression or classification models. By leveraging feature engineering, model selection, and optimization techniques, we can build accurate predictive models that provide valuable insights for decision-making.
